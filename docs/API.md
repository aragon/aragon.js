# API Reference

## AragonApp

This class is used to communicate with the wrapper in which the app is run.

Every method in this class sends an RPC message to the wrapper.

The app communicates with the wrapper using a messaging provider. The default provider uses the [MessageChannel PostMessage API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MessagePort/postMessage), but you may specify another provider to use (see the exported [providers](/docs/PROVIDERS.md) to learn more about them). You will most likely want to use the [`WindowMessage` provider](/docs/PROVIDERS.md#windowmessage) in your frontend.

### Parameters

- `provider` **[Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)** (optional, default `MessagePortMessage`): A provider used to send and receive messages to and from the wrapper. See [providers](/docs/PROVIDERS.md).

### Examples

```javascript
import AragonApp, { providers } from '@aragon/api'

// The default provider should be used in background scripts
const backgroundScriptOfApp = new AragonApp()

// The WindowMessage provider should be used for front-ends
const frontendOfApp = new AragonApp(new providers.WindowMessage(window.parent))
```

> **Note**<br>
> Most of the returned observables will propagate errors from `@aragon/wrapper` (e.g. the Aragon client) if an RPC request failed. An example would be trying to use `api.call('nonexistentFunction')`. Multi-emission observables (e.g. `api.accounts()`) will forward the error without stopping the stream, leaving the subscriber to handle the error case.

> **Note**<br>
> Although many of the API methods return observables, many of them are single-emission observables that you can turn directly into a [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise). While this is seen as an "antipattern" by experienced RxJS users, it is highly convenient when you're not working fully in the context of streams and just need a particular async value (e.g. `api.call('getVoteDetails', voteId)`). The Aragon One team recommends this approach when first developing your apps if you are not already experienced with RxJS.
>
> You can use the [`.toPromise()`](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/api/index/class/Observable#toPromise) method on all single-emission observables safely (e.g. `await api.call('getVoteDetails', voteId).toPromise()`). If you receive a multi-emission observable (e.g. `api.accounts()`) but only care about its current value, you can use the [`first()`](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/api/operators/first) operator, e.g. `api.accounts().pipe(first()).toPromise()`.

> **Note**<br>
> All methods returning observables will only send their RPC requests upon the returned observable being subscribed. For example, calling `api.increment()` will **NOT** send an intent until you have subscribed to the returned observable. This is to ensure that responses cannot be accidentally skipped.
>
> If you're not interested in the response, you can either make an "empty" subscription (i.e. `api.increment().subscribe()`), or turn it into a promise and await it (i.e. `await api.increment().toPromise()`).

## Important Concepts / APIs

### intents

To send an intent to the wrapper (i.e. invoke a method on your smart contract), simply call it on the instance of this class as if it was a JavaScript function.

For example, to execute the `increment` function in your app's smart contract:

```js
const api = new AragonApp()

// Sends an intent to the wrapper that we wish to invoke `increment` on our app's smart contract
api
  .increment(1)
  .subscribe(
    txHash => console.log(`Success! Incremented in tx ${txHash}`),
    err => console.log(`Could not increment: ${err}`)
  )
```

The intent function returns a single-emission [RxJS observable](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/api/index/class/Observable) that emits the hash of the transaction that was sent or an error if the user choose not to sign the transaction.

You can also pass an optional object after all the required function arguments to specify some transaction options. They are the same values that can be passed to `web3.eth.sendTransaction()` and the full list can be seen in the [web3.js documentation](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/1.0/web3-eth.html#id62).

```js
api.increment(1, { gas: 200000, gasPrice: 80000000 })
```

Some caveats to customizing transaction parameters:

- `from`, `to`, `data`: will be ignored as aragonAPI will calculate those.
- `gas`: If the intent cannot be performed directly (needs to be forwarded), the gas amount will be interpreted as the minimum amount of gas to send in the transaction. Because forwarding performs a heavier transaction gas-wise, if the gas estimation done by aragonAPI results in more gas than provided in the parameter, the estimated gas will prevail.

#### Pretransactions

> **Note**<br>
> Some intents may require additional transactions ahead of the actual intent, such as a token approval if the intent is to transfer tokens on the user's behalf.
> We use the concept of "pretransactions" to allow apps to easily declare that they require these actions.

**Token Approvals**

You can include a `token` parameter in the final options object if you need to grant the app an token allowance before a transaction. A slightly modified [example](https://github.com/aragon/aragon-apps/blob/7d61235044509095db09cf354f38422f0778d4bb/apps/finance/app/src/App.js#L58) from the Finance app:

```js
intentParams = {
  token: { address: tokenAddress, value: amount }
  gas: 500000
}

api.deposit(tokenAddress, amount, reference, intentParams)
```

If you want to grant the token allowance to a different contract from the current app, you can pass along a `spender` paramater in the `token` object as follows:

```js
intentParams = {
  token: { address: tokenAddress, value: amount, spender: otherContractAddress }
  gas: 500000
}

api.deposit(tokenAddress, amount, reference, intentParams)
```

### store

**Should be** used as the main "event loop" in application background scripts running in a WebWorker. Listens for events, passes them through `reducer`, caches the resulting state, and re-emits that state for easy chaining.

The store has block caching automatically applied, such that subsequent loads of the application only fetch new events from a cached ("committed") block height (rather than from `0` or the app's initialization block).

The reducer takes the signature `(state, event)` Ã  la Redux. Note that it _must always_ return a state, even if it is unaltered by the event. Returning `undefined` will reset the reduced state to its initial null state.

Also note that the initial state is always `null`, not `undefined`, because of [JSONRPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) limitations.

Optionally takes a configuration object comprised of an `init` function, to re-initialize cached state, and an `externals` array for subscribing to external contract events. See below for more details.

#### Parameters

- `reducer` **[Function](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function)**: A function that reduces events to a state. The function is allowed to be `async` and can return a Promise that resolves to the new state.
- `options` **[Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)** (optional, default `{}`): An object that initializes the store with a specific configuration:
    - `options.init` **[Function](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function)** (optional): An initialization function for the state that takes the cached state (`null` if no cached state exists) as a parameter and returns re-initialized state. The function is allowed to be `async` and can return a Promise that resolves to the state.
    - `options.externals` **[Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)** (optional): An array of external contracts whose events the store will also be subscribed to. Each element in the array is an object containing `contract` (an external contract handle returned from `api.external()`) and an optional `initializationBlock` number from which external events should be fetched from.

Returns **[Observable](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/api/index/class/Observable)**: A multi-emission observable that emits the application state every time it changes. The type of the emitted values is application specific.

#### Lifecycle

A simple representation of the store's lifecycle:

1. Obtain the store's initial state by fetching any cached ("committed") state for the app, else use `null` as the initial state
1. Fetch past events from the contract and, starting with the initial state, reduce new state based on the incoming events
  - Note that there are some "custom" built-in events at this step:
    - `SYNC_STATUS_SYNCING`: triggered when event fetching starts
    - `SYNC_STATUS_SYNCED`: triggered when event fetching is complete
1. Cache the state at the end of this initial sync as the app's "committed" state to date
1. Subscribe to new events from the contract and reduce new state based on the incoming events. Note that this state is not cached as "commited" state and will not be available on the app's next start
  - Note that there are some "custom" built-in events at this step:
    - `ACCOUNT_TRIGGER`: triggered whenever the currently connected account changes

However, with `options.init` and `options.externals`, the lifecycle becomes a bit more complicated:

1. Obtain the initial "committed" state, as before
1. If `options.init` is available, feed the initial state into `options.init`. Use the returned state from `options.init` as the new current state.
1. Fetch past events from the contract and any given `options.externals` contracts, reducing new state from found events. Note that new events from these contracts are **not** fetched until all past events have been found.
1. Cache the state as "committed" state, as before
1. Subscribe to new events from the contract and any given `options.externals` contracts, reducing new state based on the incoming events.

> **Note**<br>
> The custom events are symbols and can be fetched from the `events` export of `@aragon/api` (e.g. `import { events } from '@aragon/api'`).

#### Examples

A simple example:

```javascript
// A simple reducer for a counter app

const state$ = api.store((state, event) => {
  // Initial state is always null
  if (state === null) state = 0

  switch (event.event) {
    case 'Increment':
      state++
      return state
    case 'Decrement':
      state--
      return state
  }

  // We must always return a state, even if unaltered
  return state
})
```

A more complicated example that also includes `options.init` and `options.external`

```javascript
// A reducer that also reduces events from an external smart contract and uses
// an initialization function

const token = api.external(tokenAddress, tokenJsonInterface)

const initStore = async (cachedStoreState) => {
  // Perform any re-initializations on the cached committed state
  // This is useful for updating state (e.g. token balances, etc.) that may not
  // be // dependent on events
  const reinitializedStoreState = { ...cachedStoreState }

  // The state returned here will be used to start the reducer
  // (rather than the cached state)
  return reinitializedStoreState
}

const state$ = api.store(
  (state, event) => {
    // ...
  },
  {
    externals: {
      contract: token,
      initializationBlock: 0 // By default this uses the current AragonApp's initialization block
    },
    init: initStore,
  }
)
```
